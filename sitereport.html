	<legend class="p1"> I was among the poor students of the batch who was unable to figure-out what was going on with the codes. Understanding codes and keeping knowledge about it was a challenge for me at the moment. I guess it was harder for me to start my coding journey compared to my classmates. When I was learning things in the class and everyone was able to do exercises i felt discouraged and felt like a failure. I almost dropped out of the course as i felt coding was not for me but then i decided to give it a last try and did my best to learn things form different websites and the lecture slides that was provided to us. After watching few tutorials and doing exercises form lecture slides. I started feeling a little confident about making some basic websites. Tackling my problems and confusions on my own gave me a great boost in my confidence and was not feeling low about this course anymore. I had resit assignment because i was not able to tackle assignment on time. University gave me one more chance to prove myself which gave me a hope to work on it. I promised myself to prove and completed the assignment. In this phase our module leader and the slides were helping me lot. Learning at NAMI was one of the best decision I ever made. NAMI and our module leader gave me best experience possible. I am thankful for everyone who assisted me during this phase.</legend>
