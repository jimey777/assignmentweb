<p>Starting :<br><br> I was a beginner at coding as i never learnt much coding in my previous course. So it was really hard for me to begin my coding journey. I had a lot of confusions and doubts.</p>
<p>Practicing:<br><br> Slowly and gradually i learned and practiced it, Which made it a little easier for me to complete my assignment. The confusions i had in the past were also clear to me after that. </p>
<p>Completion:<br><br> After a lot of practice and hard work i finally completed my assignment. When i tried it a few times it became alot easier form when i started it. </p>
